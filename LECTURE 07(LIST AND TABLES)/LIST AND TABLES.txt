LISTS AND TABLES:-

LISTS:-

If we want to insert a list like this:- unordered list
*Asad
*Ali
*Ahmed
Then we will use the syntax 
<ul>
<li>Asad<li>
<li>Ali<li>
<li>Ahmed<li>
</ul>

If we want to insert a list like this:- ordered list
1. Asad
2. Ali
3. Ahmed
Then we will use the syntax 
<ol>
<li>Asad<li>
<li>Ali<li>
<li>Ahmed<li>
</ol>

If you dont want ordered list to be with 1,2,3 you can write <ol type="I"> or <ul type="i"> so that it will change it into roman. or type="a" for a,b,c order

We can also nest one list into another list
syntax :
<ul>
<li>Asad<li>
<li>Ali<li>
<li>
<ul>
   <li>Another one</li>
   <li>Second one</li>
   <li>TThirds one</li>
</ul>
<li>
</ul>

TABLES:-
To make table in html we first use syntax <h3></h3> or h4 to define the size of heading of table(it is not compulsory to put heading for a table)
Second we use <table></table> tag and put rows in this by <thead></thead> tag
table head(thead) contains all the attributes name which we define one by one in <th></th> tag

Second after closing thead tag we use table body tag which is <tbody></tbody> which contains all the values for the attributes
then we put <tr></tr> tag into tbody tag
and then td tag(table data) <td></td> one by one to insert data into rows of the table
