CSS FONTS:-

In css fonts we have one font known as font family in that we have different fonts we can use for our paragraph letters or heading letters etc.

1).WEB SAVE FONTS : The fonts which are pre-installed in the operating system. We can use them easily.

2). WEB FONTS : The fonts which are not pre installed but we have to import them from web to use them. Goggle font is the best website to import web fonts.

-> Go to google fonts.
-> Choose the font u want.
-> Click on + sign.
-> copy this link <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@1,500&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
-> Paste below the title tag and upper than style tag(between style and title)(every font style has different link)
-> Also paste the font family tag.

3). FONT STACK : A font stack is a list of fonts and font keywords used to let a browser know our preferred and fallback fonts. 
EG : font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;  

Why we use font stack? The fonts are listed in order of preference that you would like them to appear in case of a problem, such as a font not loading. A font stack allows you to control the look of the fonts on the web page even if the site visitor's computer doesn't have the initial font that you called for.

If you want to change the font size , use the property in paragraph selector p{fontsize:30px etc} .. px is the 1/96 of an inch.(pixel)

-> fontweight is used to make font bold.
-> fontstyle is used to make font sylish.
-> lineheight is used to give distance between the fonts vertically. (em is the measurement like pixel)
