BOX SHADOW: To give shadow to a box ,, if we want to give shadow from downwards we will use POSITIVE number , and if we want to give shadow from upwards we will give NEGATIVE numbers. (box-shadow:x,y,color) and for BLUR RADIUS (box-shadow: x ,y , blurradius(in pixel) , color)


INSET: If we want shadow to come inside of the box or element we will use boxshadow:inset (remaining values same) as in upper.

MULTIPLE SHADOWS: If we want to give multiple color text shadow we will use the same syntax just give comma and then write for next color like this :-
box-shadow: 10px 10px 10px lightcoral , 20px 20px 10px yellow;

TEXT SHADOW:-

We can also give the shadow to text in the same way just REPLACE BOX-SHADOW WITH TEXT-SHADOW

USE OF TEXT SHADOW: When we have image and becasuse of that image the text is not totally visible so we can use text shadow there. so it looks more professional.
USE OF BOX SHADOW: When the body background color and box colors are same we can use box shadow there to show presence of box.
