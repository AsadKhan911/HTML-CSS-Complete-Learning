ANIMATION :-

To make animation we must put 3 things

1). animation-name : Asad911 (any name)
2). animation-duration :2s  (pora animation 1 time hone k lia kitni der lay) (use infinite to run infinitely)
3). animation-iteration-count: 3,4 etc (3 ya 4 dfa wo animation show ho phir ruk jae)
4) (OPTIONAL) Aniamtion delay:3 sec (it waits for 3 sec than starts then animation.

SHORT HAND : animation: animation-name animation-duration animation-timing-function animation-delay animation-iteration-count animation-fill-mode; (WE CAN ALSO WRITE ALL THE PROPERTIES LIKE THIS IN ONE GO)
	     (animation: asad911 5s ease-in 1s 12 backwards;)

THESE ALL 3 POINTS ARE IN THAT BOX(DIV) JISKA ANIMATION DIKHANA HE.

KeyFrames:-

After giving these 3 things we will make a keyframe to design the animation (to allocate the size of the animation from - to

SYNTAX:-

  @keyframes Asad911
        {
            from
            {
                width: 200px;
            }
            to
            {
                width: 400px;
            }
        }

SECOND USE OF KEYFRAMES:-

 @keyframes Asad911
        {
          0%
          {
            top: 0px;
            left: 0px;
          }
          25%
          {
            top: 0px;
            left: 100px;
          }
          50%
          {
            top:100px;
            left: 100px;
          }
          100%
          {
            top: 100px;
            left: 0px;
          }
        }

This is used when we want k kis kis point pe animation kis trha behave kre , by the following syntax animation will move in the circle like movement.

animation-fill-mode:forwards: This is use when we want jab animation keyframe k to size tk pohcnhe to wo waha ja kr ruk jae.

animation-fill-mode:alternate: This is use when we want jab animation keyframe k to size tk pohnch kr wapis apni jaga per ajae. (this is by default set in animations).

animation-timing-function: ease-in: This is use when we want jab animation shuru me slow jae or agy ja k fast hojae.

animation-timing-function: ease-out: This is use when we want jab animation shuru me fast jae or agy ja k slow hojae.

animation-direction:reverse: This is use to play the animation in reverse.

animation-timing-function: ease-in-out: This is use when we want shuru me start hote hue bhe slow ho or end pr khtm hote hue b slow ho.
