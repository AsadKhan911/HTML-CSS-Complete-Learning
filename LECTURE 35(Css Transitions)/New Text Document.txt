TRANSITIONS:-

To make transition in element use property TRANSITION-PROPERTY: BACKGROUND-COLOR; (Or any thing you want to insert)
After that use that class or id with a hover property and set accordingly (CHECK THE TUT35.HTML IN VS CODE FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING).

We have same transitions properties for animation as well like ease-in , ease-out , transition-delay etc

We can also transit the size of an element just like we transit background color (JUST WRITE THE REQUIRED THE SIZE (WIDTH,HEIGHT) IN HOVER SECTION) and set the TRANSITION-PROPERTY: ALL Instead of BACKGROUND-COLOR.
