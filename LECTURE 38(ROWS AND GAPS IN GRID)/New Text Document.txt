CSS GRID ROWS:-

 grid-template-rows: 1fr 4fr 1fr; Suppose we have 10 row and we use this property...its mean first item take 1fr(fraction) second will take 2fr(means 1fr*2) and third will take 1fr and rest of all items will auto take 1fr space. 

If we want remaining items space to set by ourself rather than 1fr by default we will use use this:-
 grid-auto-rows: 2fr;(it will give 2fr to all the remaining rows(items))
