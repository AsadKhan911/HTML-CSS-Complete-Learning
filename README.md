# My HTML and CSS Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal HTML and CSS learning repository! üåê In this repository, I've organized my self-paced learning of HTML and CSS. Each folder represents a lecture or topic, and I've included a text file with my notes and an HTML or CSS file for practical exercises.

## Repository Structure

- Each folder is a self-contained learning module.
- Inside each folder:
  - `notes.txt`: My personal notes for the lecture or topic.
  - `practice.html` or `practice.css`: Code files for hands-on exercises.

## How I've Structured My Learning

I've learned HTML and CSS by creating practical examples and documenting my understanding in notes. The structure of this repository reflects my self-guided learning approach. Feel free to explore each folder to see how I've applied the concepts and what notes I've taken.

## Getting Started

1. Browse through the folders from `lecture-1` to `lecture-40`.
2. Open each folder to find my notes and practical exercises.
3. Feel free to explore the HTML and CSS files to see the implementation of each concept.

## Contributing

This repository is a personal learning space, but if you find any errors or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm open to learning from others as well!

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to express my gratitude to the online resources and communities that have contributed to my learning journey. Learning is a continuous process, and I'm excited to share my progress.

Keep Coding! :)‚ú®
